SHOO BE DO BA BO,
You're a big baboon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
It's a green balloon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Walrus on the moon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Lost my pantaloon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
What an ugly goon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
In the middle of June.


SHOO DO BE DO BA DO,
SHOO DO BE DO BA DO.

SHOO DO BE DO BA DO,
SHOO DO BE DO BA DO.

SHOO DO BE DO BA DO,
SHOO DO BE DO BA DO.

SHOO DO BE DO BA DO,
SHOO DO BE DO BA DO.


SHOO BE DO BA BO,
On a desert dune.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Ate a big rangoon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Enter the saloon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
He's an old cartoon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Good afternoon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Join a new commune.


SHOO DO BE DO BA DO,
SHOO DO BE DO BA DO.

SHOO DO BE DO BA DO,
SHOO DO BE DO BA DO.

SHOO DO BE DO BA DO,

SHOO DO BE DO BA DO.


SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Play the contrabassoon.

Form a cool cocoon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Is this even in tune?

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Inscribed in a rune.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Try not to swoon.

SHOO BE DO BA BO,
Are you even immune?
